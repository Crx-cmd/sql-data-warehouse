ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load. It is a process used in data integration and data warehousing to collect data from various sources, convert it into a suitable format, and store it in a destination system, such as a database or data warehouse.

ETL Process:
Extract – Retrieve data from multiple sources (databases, APIs, flat files, etc.).
Transform – Clean, format, and restructure the data (e.g., removing duplicates, converting data types, applying business rules).
Load – Store the transformed data into a target system (such as a data warehouse or analytical database).
